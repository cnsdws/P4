Description
This website is used to create stock positions in a portfolio and store them in a database. The initial create transaction also calculates a target sell price for the stock assuming a 10% increase in the price of the stock.

For each creat, update or delete action, the transaction is also recorded in a transactions database as Buy, UPD (update) or Sell (delete). The complete history of transactions can be viewed as well so that the transaction history is maintained.

The website does require a user name and password. One of which is provided below. Individuals may also sign up on the site and create their own.

The website is based on a Laravel framework and uses a mysql database.

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable, creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in the majority of web projects, such as authentication, routing, sessions, and caching.

Laravel aims to make the development process a pleasing one for the developer without sacrificing application functionality. Happy developers make the best code. To this end, we've attempted to combine the very best of what we have seen in other web frameworks, including frameworks implemented in other languages, such as Ruby on Rails, ASP.NET MVC, and Sinatra.

Laravel is accessible, yet powerful, providing powerful tools needed for large, robust applications. A superb inversion of control container, expressive migration system, and tightly integrated unit testing support give you the tools you need to build any application with which you are tasked.

## Official Documentation

Documentation for the entire framework can be found on the [Laravel website](http://laravel.com/docs).
